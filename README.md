Hi, I go by Rust. I'm a software developer, cybersecurity & cryptography enthusiast, and computer science student who usually works on private repositories. I primarily write in TypeScript, Rust, Go, and Python, but my technical skillset varies across software, networking, operating systems, and theoretical comp-sci.

## Current projects
* Bonobo | An extensive password manager with AES encryption, a web server and UI, open protocol, TUI interface (written in Rust), and a Python library. Expected to be released sometime in 2024.
* <a href="https://github.com/compscitwilight/opnserver">opnserver</a> | A Minecraft server scanner which is currently still under development.
